/**
 * A class that represents an integer expression in the model.  The expression
 * may depend on a value of a variable (or variables) and so the value of the
 * expression is not known until a solution is found.
 * The value must be in the range {@link IntVarMin} to {@link IntVarMax}.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * The following code creates two interval variables `x` and `y`
 * and an integer expression `maxEnd` that is equal to the maximum of the end
 * times of `x` and `y` (see {@link max2}):
 * ```ts
 * let model = new CP.Model();
 * let x = model.intervalVar({ length: 10, name: "x" });
 * let y = model.intervalVar({ length: 20, name: "y" });
 * let maxEnd = model.max2(x.end(), y.end());
 * ```
 *
 * ### Optional integer expressions
 *
 * Underlying variables of an integer expression may be optional, i.e. they may
 * or may not be present in a solution (for example, an optional task
 * can be completely omitted from the solution). In this case the value of the
 * integer expression is _absent_. The value _absent_ means that the variable
 * has no meaning, it does not exist in the solution.
 *
 * With an exception of {@link guard} expression, any value of an integer
 * expression that depends on an absent variable is also _absent_.
 * As we don't know the value of the expression before the solution is found,
 * we call such expression _optional_.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * In the following model, there is optional interval variable `x` and
 * non-optional interval variable `y`.  We add a constraint that end of `x` plus
 * 10 must be less or equal to the start of `y`:
 * ```ts
 * let model = new CP.Model();
 * let x = model.intervalVar({ length: 10, name: "x", optional: true });
 * let y = model.intervalVar({ length: 20, name: "y" });
 * let endX = model.endOf(x);
 * let afterX = endX.plus(10);
 * let startY = model.startOf(y);
 * let isBefore = afterX.le(startY);
 * model.constraint(isBefore);
 * let result = await CP.solve(model);
 * ```
 * In this model:
 *
 *  * `endX` is an optional integer expression because it depends on
 *     an optional variable `x`.
 *  * The expression `afterX` is optional for the same reason.
 *  * The expression `startY` is not optional because it depends only on a
 *    non-optional variable `y`.
 *  * Boolean expression `isBefore` is also optional. It's value could be
 *    _true_, _false_ or _absent_.
 *
 * The expression `isBefore` is turned into a constraint using
 * {@link Model.constraint | Model.constraint}. Therefore it cannot be _false_
 * in the solution. However it can still be _absent_. Therefore the constraint
 * `isBefore` can be satisfied in two ways:
 *
 * 1. Both `x` and `y` are present, `x` is before `y` and the delay between them
 *    is at least 10. In this case `isBefore` is _true_.
 * 2. `x` is absent and `y` is present. In this case `isBefore` is _absent_.

/**
 * A class that represents a boolean expression in the model.
 * The expression may depend on one or more variables and therefore its value
 * may be unknown until a solution is found.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * For example, the following code creates two interval variables `x` and `y`
 * and a boolean expression `isBefore` that is true if `x` ends before `y` starts,
 * that is, if the end of `x` is less than or equal to
 * the start of `y` (see {@link IntExpr.le | IntExpr.le}):
 * ```ts
 * let model = new CP.Model();
 * let x = model.intervalVar({ length: 10, name: "x" });
 * let y = model.intervalVar({ length: 20, name: "y" });
 * let isBefore = x.end().le(y.start());
 * let result = await CP.solve(model);
 * ```
 *
 * Boolean expressions can be used to create constraints using function {@link
 * Model.constraint | Model.constraint}. In the example above, we may require that `isBefore` is
 * true:
 * ```ts
 * model.constraint(isBefore);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Optional boolean expressions
 *
 * _OptalCP_ is using 3-value logic: a boolean expression can be _true_, _false_
 * or _absent_. Typically the the expression is _absent_ only if one or
 * more underlying variables is _absent_.  The value _absent_
 * means that the expression doesn't have a meaning because one or more
 * underlying variables are absent (they are not part of the solution).
 *
 * ### Difference between constraints and boolean expressions
 *
 * Boolean expressions can take arbitrary value (_true_, _false_, or _absent_)
 * and can be combined into composed expressions (e.g. using {@link and} or
 * {@link or}).
 *
 * Constraints can only be _true_ or _absent_ (in a solution) and cannot
 * be combined into composed expressions.
 *
 * Some functions create constraints directly, e.g. {@link Model.noOverlap}.
 * Then, it is not necessary to to pass them to function {@link Model.constraint}.
 * It is also not possible to combine constraints into composed expressions
 * such as `or(noOverlap(..), noOverlap(..))`.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * Let's consider a similar example to the one above but with optional interval
 * variables `a` and `b`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * let model = new CP.Model();
 * let a = model.intervalVar({ length: 10, name: "a", optional: true });
 * let b = model.intervalVar({ length: 20, name: "b", optional: true });
 * let isBefore = a.end().le(b.start());
 * model.constraint(isBefore);
 * let result = await CP.solve(model);
 * ```
 *
 * The function {@link Model.constraint | Model.constraint} requires that the
 * constraint cannot be _false_ in a solution. It could be _absent_ though.
 * Therefore, in our example, there are four kinds of solutions:
 *
 * 1. Both `a` and `b` are present and `a` ends before `b` starts.
 * 2. Only `a` is present and `b` is absent.
 * 3. Only `b` is present and `a` is absent.
 * 4. Both `a` and `b` are absent.
 *
 * In the case 1 the expression `isBefore` is _true_. In all the other cases
 * `isBefore` is _absent_ as at least one of the variables `a` and `b` is
 * absent, and then `isBefore` doesn't have a meaning.
 *
 * ### Boolean expressions as integer expressions
 *
 * Class `BoolExpr` derives from {@link IntExpr}. Therefore boolean expressions can be used
 * as integer expressions. In this case _true_ is equal to _1_, _false_ is
 * equal to _0_, and _absent_ remains _absent_.

/**
 * Interval variable is a task, action, operation or any other interval with a start
 * and an end. The start and the end of the interval are unknowns that the solver
 * has to find. They could be accessed as integer expressions using
 * {@link IntervalVar.start | IntervalVar.start} and {@link IntervalVar.end | IntervalVar.end}.
 * or using {@link Model.startOf | Model.startOf} and {@link Model.endOf | Model.endOf}.
 * In addition to the start and the end of the interval, the interval variable
 * has a length (equal to _end - start_) that can be accessed using
 * {@link IntervalVar.length | IntervalVar.length} or {@link Model.lengthOf | Model.lengthOf}.
 *
 * The interval variable can be optional. In this case the solver can decide
 * to make the interval absent, what is usually interpreted as the fact that
 * the interval doesn't exist, the task/action was not executed or the operation
 * was not performed.  When the interval variable is absent then its start, end
 * and length are also absent.  Boolean expression that represents the presence
 * of the interval variable can be accessed using
 * {@link IntervalVar.presence | IntervalVar.presence} and {@link Model.presenceOf | Model.presenceOf}.
 *
 *
 * Interval variables can be created using function
 * {@link Model.intervalVar | Model.intervalVar}.
 * By default, interval variables are _present_ (not optional).
 * To create an optional interval, specify `optional: true` in the
 * arguments of the function.
 *
 * @example: present interval variables
 *
 * In the following example we create three present interval variables `x`, `y` and `z`
 * and we make sure that they don't overlap.  Then we minimize the maximum of
 * the end times of the three intervals (the makespan):
 * ```ts
 * let model = CP.Model();
 * let x = model.intervalVar({ length: 10, name: "x" });
 * let y = model.intervalVar({ length: 10, name: "y" });
 * let z = model.intervalVar({ length: 10, name: "z" });
 * model.noOverlap([x, y, z]);
 * model.max([x.end(), y.end(), z.end()]).minimize();
 * let result = await CP.solve(model);
 * ```
 *
 * @example: optional interval variables
 *
 * In the following example, there is a task _X_ that could be performed by two
 * different workers _A_ and _B_.  Interval variable `X` represents the task,
 * it is not optional because the task `X` is mandatory. Interval variable
 * `XA` represents the task `X` in the case when performed by worker _A_ and
 * similarly `XB` represents the task `X` in the case when performed by worker _B_.
 * Both `XA` and `XB` are optional because it is not known beforehand which
 * worker will perform the task.  The constraint {@link alternative} links
 * `X`, `XA` and `XB` together and ensures that only one of `XA` and `XB` is present and that
 * `X` and the present interval are equal.
 *
 * ```ts
 * let model = CP.Model();
 * let X = model.intervalVar({ length: 10, name: "X" });
 * let XA = model.intervalVar({ name: "XA", optional: true });
 * let XB = model.intervalVar({ name: "XB", optional: true });
 * model.alternative(X, [XA, XB]);
 * let result = await CP.solve(model);
 * ```
 * Variables `XA` and `XB` can be used elsewhere in the model, e.g. to make sure
 * that each worker is assigned to at most one task at a time:
 * ```ts
 * // Tasks of worker A don't overlap:
 * model.noOverlap([... , XA, ...]);
 * // Tasks of worker B don't overlap:
 * model.noOverlap([... , XB, ...]);
 * ```

     *
     * @remarks
     *
     * The `noOverlap` constraint make sure that the intervals in the sequence
     * do not overlap.  That is, for every pair of interval variables `x` and `y`
     * at least one of the following conditions must hold (in a solution):
     *
     * 1. Interval variable `x` is _absent_. This means that the interval is not
     *    present in the solution (not performed) and therefore it cannot overlap
     *    with any other interval. Only optional interval variables can be _absent_.
     * 2. Interval variable `y` is _absent_.
     * 3. `x` ends before `y` starts, i.e. `x.end()` is less or equal to `y.start()`.
     * 4. `y` ends before `x` starts, i.e. `y.end()` is less or equal to `x.start()`.
     *
     * In addition, if `transitions` parameter is specified then the cases 3 and 4
     * are further constrained by the minimum transition distance between the
     * intervals:
     *
     * 3. `x.end() + transitions[x.type][y.type]` is less or equal to `y.start()`.
     * 4. `y.end() + transitions[y.type][x.type]` is less or equal to `x.start()`.
     *
     * where `x.type` and `y.type` are the types of the interval variables `x` and `y`
     * as given in {@link Model.sequenceVar | Model.sequenceVar}. If types were not specified
     * then they are equal to the indices of the interval variables in the array
     * passed to {@link Model.sequenceVar | Model.sequenceVar}. Transition times
     * cannot be negative.
     *
     * Note that transition times are enforced between every pair of interval variables,
     * no only between direct neighbors.
     *
     * The size of the 2D array `transitions` must be equal to the number of types
     * of the interval variables.
     *
     * This constraint is the same as
     * {@link Model.noOverlap | Model.noOverlap(sequenceVar, ..)}.
     * Constraint
     * {@link Model.noOverlap | Model.noOverlap(intervalVarVar[], ..)}
     * is also the same but specifies the intervals directly instead of using
     * a sequence variable.
     *
     * @example
     *
     * A worker must perform a set of tasks. Each task is characterized by:
     *
     * * `length` of the task (how long it takes to perform it),
     * * `location` of the task (where it must be performed),
     * * a time window `startMin` to `endMax` when the task must be performed.
     *
     * There are three locations `0`, `1` and `2`, the minimum travel time between
     * the locations is given by a transition matrix `transitions`. Transition times
     * are not symmetric. For example, it takes 10 minutes to travel from location `0`
     * to location `1` but 15 minutes to travel back from location `1` to location `0`.
     *
     * We are going to model this problem using `noOverlap` constraint with transition times.
     *
     * ```ts
     * // Travel times between locations:

 * Cumulative expression.
 *
 * Cumulative expression represents a resource usage over time.  The resource
 * could be a machine, a group of workers, a material, anything of a limited
 * capacity.  The resource usage is not known in advance as it depends on the
 * variables of the problem.  Cumulative expressions allow to model the resource
 * usage and constrain it.
 *
 * Basic cumulative expressions are:
 *
 * * ***Pulse***: the resource is used over an interval of time.
 *   For example, pulse can be used to represent a task that requires certain
 *   number of workers during its execution.  At the beginning of the interval
 *   the resource usage increases by a given amount and at the end of the
 *   interval the resource usage decreases by the same amount.
 *   Pulse can be created by function {@link Model.pulse | Model.pulse}
 *   or {@link IntervalVar.pulse | IntervalVar.pulse }.
 * * ***Step***: given amount of resource is consumed or produced at a specified
 *   time (e.g. at a start of an interval variable).
 *   Steps can be used to represent an inventory of a material that is
 *   consumed or produced by some tasks (a _reservoir_).
 *   Steps can be created by functions
 *   {@link Model.stepAtStart | Model.stepAtStart},
 *   {@link IntervalVar.stepAtStart | IntervalVar.stepAtStart},
 *   {@link Model.stepAtEnd | Model.stepAtEnd},
 *   {@link IntervalVar.stepAtEnd | IntervalVar.stepAtEnd}. and
 *   {@link Model.stepAt | Model.stepAt}.
 *
 * Cumulative expressions can be combined together using
 * {@link Model.cumulPlus}, {@link Model.cumulMinus}, {@link cumulNeg} and
 * {@link Model.cumulSum}.  The resulting cumulative expression represents
 * a sum of the resource usage of the combined expressions.
 *
 * Cumulative expressions can be constrained by {@link Model.cumulGe} and
 * {@link Model.cumulLe} constraints to specify the minimum and maximum
 * allowed resource usage.

/**
 * Parameters allow to specify how the solver should behave.  For example, the
 * number of workers (threads) to use, the time limit, etc.
 *
 * Parameters can be passed to the solver using function {@link solve}
 * or by constructor of the class {@link Solver}.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * In the following example, we are using the _TimeLimit_ parameter to specify
 * that the solver should stop after 5 minutes. We also specify that the solver
 * should use 4 threads. Finally, we specify that the solver should use
 * _FDS_ search (in all threads).
 * ```ts
 * let params = {
 *   timeLimit: 300, // In seconds, i.e. 5 minutes
 *   nbWorkers: 4,   // Use 4 threads
 *   searchType: "FDS"
 * };
 * let result = await CP.solve(myModel, params);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Worker-specific parameters
 *
 * Some parameters can be specified differently for each worker.  For example,
 * some workers may use _LNS_ search while others use _FDS_ search.  To specify
 * worker-specific parameters, use the _workers_ parameter and pass an array
 * of {@link WorkerParameters}.
 *
 * Not all parameters can be specified per worker, for example _TimeLimit_ is a
 * global parameter. See {@link WorkerParameters} for the list of parameters
 * that can be specified per worker.
 *
 * If a parameter is not set specifically for a worker, the global value is used.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * In the following example, we are going to use 4 workers, two of them will run
 * _FDS_ search and the remaining two will run _LNS_ search.  In addition, workers
 * that use _FDS_ search will use increased propagation levels.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Parameters for a worker that uses FDS search.
 * // FDS works best with increased propagation levels, so set them:
 * let fdsWorker: CP.WorkerParameters = {
 *   searchType: "FDS",
 *   noOverlapPropagationLevel: 4,
 *   cumulPropagationLevel: 3,
 *   reservoirPropagationLevel: 2
 * };
 * // Global parameters:
 * let params = {
 *   timeLimit: 60,        // In seconds, i.e. 1 minute
 *   searchType: "LNS",   // The default search type. Not necessary as "LNS" is the default value.
 *   nbWorkers: 4,        // Use 4 threads
 *   // The first two workers will use FDS search.
 *   // The remaining two workers will use the defaults, i.e. LNS search with default propagation levels.
 *   workers = [fdsWorker, fdsWorker];
 * };
 * let result = await CP.solve(myModel, params);
 * ```

 * _Model_ captures the problem to be solved. It contains variables,

 *
 * To create an optimization model, you need to first create a _Model_ object.

 * intervalVar}), the objective function ({@link minimize} or {@link maximize})
 * and constraints (e.g. {@link constraint} or {@link noOverlap}).
 * Note that a boolean expression becomes a constraint only by passing it to

 * @example
 *
 * Our goal is to schedule a set of tasks such that it is finished as soon as
 * possible (i.e. the makespan is minimized).  Each task has a fixed duration and
 * it cannot be interrupted.  Moreover, each tasks needs a certain number of
 * workers to be executed and the total number of workers is limited.
 * The input data are generated randomly.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import * as CP from '@scheduleopt/optalcp';
 *
 * // Constants for random problem generation:
 * const nbTasks = 100;
 * const nbWorkers = 5;
 * const maxDuration = 100;
 *
 * // Start by creating the model:
 * let model = new CP.Model();
 *
 * // For each task we will have an interval variable and a cumulative expression:
 * let tasks : CP.IntervalVar[] = [];
 * let workerUsage: CP.CumulExpr[] = [];
 *
 * // Loop over the tasks:
 * for (let i = 0; i < nbTasks; i++) {
 *   // Generate random task length:
 *   const taskLength = 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxDuration - 1));
 *   // Create the interval variable for the task:
 *   let task = model.intervalVar({ name: "Task" + (i + 1), length: taskLength });
 *   // And store it in the array:
 *   tasks.push(task);
 *   // Generate random number of workers needed for the task:
 *   const workersNeeded = 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * (nbWorkers - 1));
 *   // Create the pulse that increases the number of workers used during the task:
 *   workerUsage.push(task.pulse(workersNeeded));
 * }
 *
 * // Limit the sum of the pulses to the number of workers available:
 * model.cumulSum(workerUsage).cumulLe(nbWorkers);
 * // From an array of tasks, create an array of their ends:
 * let ends = tasks.map(t => t.end());
 * // And minimize the maximum of the ends:
 * model.max(ends).minimize();
 *
 * try {
 *   // Solve the model with the provided parameters:
 *   let result = await CP.solve(model, {
 *     timeLimit: 3, // Stop after 3 seconds
 *     nbWorkers: 4, // Use for CPU threads
 *   });
 *
 *   if (result.nbSolutions == 0)
 *     console.log("No solution found.");
 *   else {
 *     const solution = result.bestSolution!;
 *     // Note that in evaluation version of the solver, the variable values //
 *     the solution are masked, i.e. they are all _absent_ (`null` in JavaScript).
 *     // Objective value is not masked though.
 *     console.log("Solution found with makespan " + solution.getObjective());
 *     for (let task of tasks) {
 *       let start = solution.getStart(task);
 *       if (start !== null)
 *         console.log("Task " + task.getName() + " starts at " + );
 *       else
 *         console.log("Task " + task.getName() + " is absent (not scheduled).")
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * } catch (e) {
 *   // In case of error, CP.solve returns rejected promise.
 *   // Therefore "await CP.solve" throws an exception.
 *   console.log("Error: " + (e as Error).message);

    * let taskProfits: CP.IntExpr[] = [];
    *
    * for (let i = 0; i < lengths.length; i++) {
    *   // All tasks must finish before time 100:
    *   let task = model.intervalVar({ name: "Task" + i, optional: true, length: lengths[i], end: [, 100]});
    *   tasks.push(task);
    *   taskProfits.push(model.times(task.presence(), profits[i]));
    * }

    * // Tasks cannot overlap:

    *
    * @param main The main interval variable.
    * @param options Array of optional interval variables to chose from.
    *
    * @remarks
    *
    * Alternative constraint is a way to model various kind of alternative choices. For example, we can model a task that could be done by worker A, B, or C. To model such alternative, we use interval variable `main` that represents the task regardless the chosen worker and three interval variables `options = [A, B, C]` that represent the task when done by worker A, B, or C. Interval variables `A`, `B` and `C` should be optional. This way, if e.g. option B is chosen, then `B` will be _present_ and equal to `main` (they will start at the same time and end at the same time), the remaining options A and C will be _absent_.
    *
    * We may also decide not to execute the `main` task at all (if it is optional). Then `main` will be _absent_ and all options `A`, `B` and `C` will be _absent_ too.
    *
    * #### Formal definition
    *
    * The constraint `alternative(main, options)` is satisfied in the following two cases:
    * 1. Interval `main` is _absent_ and all `options[i]` are _absent_ too.
    * 2. Interval `main` is _present_ and exactly one of `options[i]` is _present_ (the remaining options are _absent_).    Let `k` be the index of the present option.    Then `main.start() == options[k].start()` and `main.end() == options[k].end()`.
    *
    * @example
    *
    * Let's consider a task T that can be done by worker A, B, or C. The length of the task and a cost associated with it depends on the chosen worker:
    *
    * * If done by worker A then its length is 10 and the cost is 5.
    * * If done by worker B then its length is 20 and the cost is 2.
    * * If done by worker C then its length is 3 and the cost is 10.
    *
    * Each worker can execute only one task at a time. The remaining tasks are omitted in the model below though. The objective could be e.g. to minimize the total cost (also omitted in the model).
    *
    * ```ts
    * let model = new CP.Model;
    *
    * let T = model.intervalVar({ name: "T" });
    * let T_A = model.intervalVar({ name: "T_A", optional: true, length: 10 });
    * let T_B = model.intervalVar({ name: "T_B", optional: true, length: 20 });
    * let T_C = model.intervalVar({ name: "T_C", optional: true, length: 3 });
    *
    * // T_A, T_B and T_C are different ways to execute task T:
    * model.alternative(T, [T_A, T_B, T_C]);
    * // The cost depends on the chosen option:
    * let costOfT = model.sum([
    *   T_A.presence().times(5),
    *   T_B.presence().times(2),
    *   T_C.presence().times(10)
    * ]);
    *
    * // Each worker A can perform only one task at a time:
    * model.noOverlap([T_A, ...]);  // Worker A
    * model.noOverlap([T_B, ...]);  // Worker B
    * model.noOverlap([T_C, ...]);  // Worker C
    *
    * // Minimize the total cost:
    * model.sum([costOfT, ...]).minimize();
    * ```

    /**

    *
    * @param main The spanning interval variable.
    * @param covered The set of interval variables to cover.
    *
    * @remarks
    *
    * Span constraint can be used to model, for example, a composite task that consists of several subtasks.
    *
    * The constraint makes sure that interval variable `main` starts with the first interval in `covered` and ends with the last interval in `covered`. Absent interval variables in `covered` are ignored.
    *
    * #### Formal definition
    *
    * Span constraint is satisfied in one of the following two cases:
    *
    * * Interval variable `main` is absent and all interval variables in `covered` are absent too.
    * * Interval variable `main` is present, at least on interval in `covered` is present and:
    *
    *    * `main.start()` is equal to the minimum of starting times of all present intervals in `covered`.
    *    * `main.end()` is equal to the maximum of ending times of all present intervals in `covered`.
    *
    * @example
    *
    * Lets consider composite task `T` that consists of 3 subtasks `T1`, `T2` and `T3`. Subtasks are independent, could be processed in any order and may overlap. However task T is blocking a particular location and no other task can be processed there. The location is blocked as soon as the first task from `T1`, `T2`, `T3` starts and it remains blocked until the last one of them finishes.

    *
    * Pulse can be used to model resource requirement during an interval variable. The given amount `height` of the resource is used during the whole interval (from its start to end).

    * Pulse creates a cumulative function which have the value:

    * * `0` after `interval.end()`

    * Cumulative functions can be combined together using {@link Model.cumulPlus}, {@link Model.cumulMinus}, {@link Model.cumulNeg} and {@link Model.cumulSum}. The minimum and the maximum height of a cumulative function can be constrained using {@link Model.cumulLe} and {@link Model.cumulGe}.

     * @param transitions A 2D square array of minimum transition times between the intervals.

     *
     * @remarks
     *
     * This function constrains a set of interval variables to not overlap.
     * That is, for each pair of interval variables `x` and `y`, one of the
     * following must hold:
     *
     * 1. Interval variable `x` or `y` is _absent_. In this case, the absent interval
     *    is not scheduled (the task is not performed) and therefore it cannot overlap
     *    with any other interval. Only _optional_ interval variables can be _absent_.
     * 2. Interval variable `x` is before `y`, that is, `x.end()` is less than or
     *    equal to `y.start()`.
     * 3. Interval variable `y` is before `x`, that is, `y.end()` is less than or
     *    equal to `x.start()`.
     *
     * The function can also take a square array `transitions` of minimum
     * transition times between the intervals. The transition time is the time
     * that must elapse between the end of the first interval and the start of the
     * second interval. The transition time cannot be negative. When transition
     * times are specified, the above conditions 2 and 3 are modified as follows:
     *
     * 2. `x.end() + transition[i][j]` is less than or equal to `y.start()`.
     * 3. `y.end() + transition[j][i]` is less than or equal to `x.start()`.
     *
     * Where `i` and `j` are indices of `x` and `y` in the array of interval
     * variables.
     *
     * Note that minimum transition times are enforced between all pairs of
     * intervals, not only between direct neighbors.
     *
     * Functionally this constraint is the same as
     * {@link SequenceVar.noOverlap | SequenceVar.noOverlap}
     * and {@link Model.noOverlap | Model.noOverlap(SequenceVar, ...)}.
     * The difference is that this function takes an array of interval variables
     * as an argument instead of a sequence variable.
     *
     * @example
     *
     * The following example does not use transition times. For an example with
     * transition times see {@link SequenceVar.noOverlap | SequenceVar.noOverlap}.
     *
     * Let's consider a set of tasks that must be performed by a single machine.
     * The machine is able to handle only one task at a time. Each task is
     * characterized by its length and a deadline. The goal is to schedule the
     * tasks on the machine such that the number of missed deadlines is minimized.
     *
     * ```ts
     * let tasks = [
     *   { length: 10, deadline: 70 },
     *   { length: 20, deadline: 50 },
     *   { length: 15, deadline: 50},
     *   { length: 30, deadline: 100 },
     *   { length: 20, deadline: 120 },
     *   { length: 25, deadline: 90 },
     *   { length: 30, deadline: 80 },
     *   { length: 10, deadline: 40 },
     *   { length: 20, deadline: 60 },
     *   { length: 25, deadline: 150 },
     * ];
  
     * let model = new CP.Model;
  
     * // An interval variable for each task. Begin with an empty array:
     * let taskVars: CP.IntervalVar[] = [];
     * // A boolean expression that is true if the task is late:
     * let isLate: CP.BoolExpr[] = [];
  
     * // Fill the arrays:
     * for (let i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
     *   let task = tasks[i];
     *   let taskVar = model.intervalVar({ name: "Task" + i, length: task.length});
     *   taskVars.push(taskVar);
     *   isLate.push(model.ge(taskVar.end(), task.deadline));
     * }
  
     * // Tasks cannot overlap:
     * model.noOverlap(taskVars);
     * // Minimize the number of late tasks:
     * model.sum(isLate).minimize();
  
     * await CP.solve(model, { searchType: "FDS" });

     *
     * @remarks
     * A boolean expression that is _not_ turned into a constraint can have
     * arbitrary value in the solution.
     *
     * @example
     *
     * In the following example, we create a boolean expression `endsBefore50`
     * that checks whether the end of interval variable `x` is before 50.
     * We don't turn it into a constraint yet:
     *
     * ```ts
     * let model = new CP.Model();
     * let x = model.intervalVar({ name: "x", length: 10, optional: true });
     * let endsBefore50 = x.end().le(50);
     * ```
     *
     * Because `endsBefore50` is not a constraint, it can take arbitrary
     * value in a solution, in particular:
     *
     * 1. `endsBefore50` is _true_ if `x` is present and its end is less than or equal to 50.
     * 2. `endsBefore50` is _false_ if `x` is present and its end is greater than 50.
     * 3. `endsBefore50` is _absent_ if `x` is absent.
     *
     * Now we turn `endsBefore50` into a constraint:
     *
     * ```ts
     * model.constraint(endsBefore50);
     * ```
     *
     * When `endsBefore50` is a constraint, it can only be _true_ or _absent_ in
     * the solution.  Therefore, cases 1 and 3 above can happen but case 2 cannot.
     *
     * #### Difference between constraints and boolean expressions
     *
     * Boolean expressions can take arbitrary value (_true_, _false_, or _absent_)
     * and can be combined into composed expressions (e.g. using {@link and} or
     * {@link or}).
     *
     * Constraints can only be _true_ or _absent_ (in a solution) and cannot
     * be combined into composed expressions.
     *
     * Some functions create constraints directly, e.g. {@link noOverlap}.
     * Then, it is not necessary to to pass them to function {@link constraint}.
     * It is also not possible to combine constraints into composed expressions
     * such as `or(noOverlap(..), noOverlap(..))`.

     * model.constraint(model.presenceOf(x).eq(model.presenceOf(y)));
     * ```
     *
     * #### Simple constraints over presence
     *
     * The solver treats binary constraints over presence in a special way: it
     * uses them to better propagate other constraints over the same pairs of variables.
     * Let's extend the previous example by a constraint that `x` must end before
     * `y` starts:
     *
     * ```ts
     * let x = model.intervalVar({ name: "x", optional: true, length: 10, start: [0, 100] });
     * let y = model.intervalVar({ name: "y", optional: true, length: 10, start: [0, 100] });
     * model.constraint(model.presenceOf(x).eq(model.presenceOf(y)));
     * // x.end <= y.start:
     * let isBefore = x.end().le(y.start());
     * model.constraint(isBefore);
     * ```
     *
     * In this example the solver sees (propagates) that the minimum start time of
     * `y` is 10 and maximum end time of `x` is 90.  Without the constraint over
     * `presenceOf`, the solver could not propagate that because in this case one
     * of the intervals can be _absent_ and the other one _present_ (and so the
     * value of `isBefore` would be _absent_ and the constraint would be
     * satisfied).
     *
     * In order to achieve good propagation, it is recommended to use binary
     * constraints over `presenceOf` when possible. E.g. use multiple binary
     * constraints instead of a single big constraint.

/**
 * Solver provides asynchronous communication with the solver.
 *
 * Unlike function {@link solve}, `Solver` allows to process individual events
 * happening during the solve and also stop the solver at any time.  If you're
 * interested in the final result only, use {@link solve} instead.
 *
 * To solve a model, create a new `Solver` object and call its method {@link Solver.solve}.
 *
 * Solver inherits from `EventEmitter` class from Node.js.  You can subscribe to
 * events using the standard Node.js `on` method.  The following events are
 * emitted:
 *   * `error`: Emits an instance of `Error` (standard Node.js class) when an error occurs.
 *   * `warning`: Emits a `string` for every issued warning.
 *   * `log`: Emits a `string` for every log message.
 *   * `trace`: Emits a `string` for every trace message.
 *   * `solution`: Emits a {@link SolutionEvent} when a solution is found.
 *   * `lowerBound`: Emits a {@link LowerBoundEvent} when a new lower bound is proved.
 *   * `summary`: Emits {@link SolveSummary} at the end of the solve.
 *   * `close`: Emits `void`. It is always the last event emitted.
 *
 * The solver output (log, trace and warnings) is printed on console by default,
 * it can be redirected to a file or a stream or suppressed completely using
 * function {@link redirectOutput}.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * In the following example, we run a solver asynchronously. We subscribe to
 * the `solution` event to print the objective value of the solution
 * and value of interval variable `x`. After the first solution is found, we request
 * the solver to stop.
 * We also subscribe to the `summary` event to print statistics about the solve.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import * as CP from '@scheduleopt/optalcp';
 *
 * ...
 * let model = new CP.Model();
 * let x = model.intervalVar({ ... });
 * ...
 *
 * // Create a new solver:
 * let solver = new CP.Solver;
 *
 * // Subscribe to "solution" events:
 * solver.on("solution", (msg: CP.SolutionEvent) => {
 *   // Get Solution from SolutionEvent:
 *   let solution = msg.solution;
 *   console.log("At time " + msg.solveTime + ", solution found with objective " + solution.getObjective());
 *   // Print value of interval variable x:
 *   if (solution.isAbsent(x))
 *     console.log("  Interval variable x is absent");
 *   else
 *     console.log("  Interval variable x: [" + solution.getStart(x) + " -- " + solution.getEnd(x) + "]");
 *   // Request the solver to stop as soon as possible
 *   // (the message is only informative):
 *   solver.stop("We are happy with the first solution found.");
 * });
 *
 * // Subscribe to "summary" events:
 * solver.on("summary", (msg: CP.SolveSummary) => {
 *   // Print the statistics. The statistics doesn't exist if an error occurred.
 *   console.log("Total duration of solve: " + msg.duration);
 *   console.log("Number of branches: " + msg.nbBranches);
 * });
 *
 * try {
 *   await solver.solve(model, { timeLimit: 60 });
 *   console.log("All done");
 * } catch (e) {
 *   // We did not subscribe to "error" events. So an exception is thrown in
 *   // case of an error.
 *   console.error("Exception caught: ", (e as Error).message);
 * }

 * @returns The result of propagation.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Propagation removes infeasible values from variable domains.
 * In general, it shrinks the domains but it doesn't fix variables to values.
 * In some cases propagation can prove that the model is infeasible.
 *
 * Sometimes it may be useful to check what the solver can compute
 * by constraint propagation and what it cannot. For example,
 * if some obviously infeasible values are not removed from
 * variable domains then some redundant constraint can be added.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * In the following example, we have 4 tasks `task[0]`, `task[1]`, `task[2]`,
 * `task[3]`, and 2 workers.  Each task can be assigned to any worker and the
 * tasks can be processed in any order. All tasks have length 10 and must finish
 * before time 19.
 *
 * In the first model we will use constraints {@link Model.alternative} to
 * chose a worker for each tasks.  And we check that constraint propagation
 * correctly propagates the length of the tasks to the workers.
 *
 * ```ts
 * let model = new CP.Model();
 * const nbTasks = 4;
 *
 * // For each task we will create three interval variables:
 * //   * tasks[i]: the task itself
 * //   * tasksWorker1[i]: the task if executed by worker1
 * //   * tasksWorker2[i]: the task if executed by worker2
 * let tasks: CP.IntervalVar[] = [];
 * let tasksWorker1: CP.IntervalVar[] = [];
 * let tasksWorker2: CP.IntervalVar[] = [];
 *
 * for (let i = 0; i < nbTasks; i++) {
 *   // Create the task itself. It has length 10 and must finish before 19:
 *   tasks.push(model.intervalVar({ name: "Task" + (i + 1), length: 10, end: [, 19] }));
 *   // Create the variables for workers. Those variables are optional
 *   // since we don't know which worker will execute the task.
 *   // Notice that we don't specify the length of those interval variables.
 *   tasksWorker1.push(model.intervalVar({ name: "Task" + (i + 1) + "Worker1", optional: true }));
 *   tasksWorker2.push(model.intervalVar({ name: "Task" + (i + 1) + "Worker2", optional: true }));
 *   // Alternative constraint between the task and the two worker variables
 *   // makes sure that exactly one of the two workers executes the task:
 *   model.alternative(tasks[i], [tasksWorker1[i], tasksWorker2[i]]);
 *   // All tasks must finish before the time 19:
 *   model.constraint(model.le(tasks[i].end(), 19));
 * }
 *
 * // Tasks of each worker cannot overlap:
 * model.noOverlap(tasksWorker1);
 * model.noOverlap(tasksWorker2);

 * try {

 *   // Propagate using the maximum propagation on noOverlap constraint:
 *   let result = await CP.propagate(model, { noOverlapPropagationLevel: 4 });
 *   if (typeof result.domains === "string") {
 *     // The model is infeasible or a timeout occurred:
 *     console.log("The result of the propagation is: " + result.domains);
 *   } else {
 *     // Check computed length of one of the optional tasks:
 *     console.log("Length of Task1Worker1 is: " +
 *       result.domains.getLengthMin(tasksWorker1[0]) + ".." + result.domains.getLengthMax(tasksWorker1[0]));
 *   }
 *
 * } catch (e) {
 *   // In case of an error CP.propagate returns a rejected promise so an exception is thrown
 *   console.log("Error caught: " + e);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The output of the program is:
 *
 * ```text
 * Length of Task1Worker1 is: 10..10
 * ```
 *
 * As we can see, the length 10 is correctly propagated from `Task1` to `Task1Worker1`.
 * However propagation did not prove that the model is infeasible: there is no way
 * to execute four tasks of length 10 before time 19 using only 2 workers.
 *
 * Let's remodel this problem using a cumulative constraint. The idea is that
 * the workers are interchangeable and we can assign tasks to workers in
 * postprocessing.
 *
 * ```ts
 * let model = new CP.Model();
 * const nbTasks = 4;
 *
 * // For each task we will create an interval variable
 * // and also a pulse for cumulative constraint:
 * let tasks: CP.IntervalVar[] = [];
 * let pulses: CP.CumulExpr[] = [];
 *
 * for (let i = 0; i < nbTasks; i++) {
 *   // Create the task. It has length 10 and must finish before 19:
 *   tasks.push(model.intervalVar({ name: "Task" + (i + 1), length: 10, end: [, 19] }));
 *   // And its pulse:
 *   pulses.push(tasks[i].pulse(1));
 * }
 *
 * // Cumulative constraint makes sure that we don't use more than 2 workers at a time:
 * model.cumulSum(pulses).cumulLe(2);
 *
 * try {
 *
 *   // Propagate using the maximum propagation for cumul constraints:
 *   let result = await CP.propagate(model, { cumulPropagationLevel: 3});
 *   if (typeof result.domains === "string") {
 *     // The model is infeasible or a timeout occurred:
 *     console.log("The result of the propagation is: " + result.domains);
 *   } else
 *     console.log("The propagation did not detect infeasibility.");
 *
 * } catch (e) {
 *   // In case of an error CP.propagate returns a rejected promise so an exception is thrown
 *   console.log("Error caught: " + e);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This time the output is:
 *
 * ```text
 * The result of the propagation is: infeasible
 * ```
 *
 * As we can see, this model propagates more then the previous one.

 *
 * This function is used to run benchmarks of the solver. It can be used to
 * solve a single model or multiple models. The models can be generated from
 * data files, or they can be generated on the fly. The function can also
 * export the models into JSON, JavaScript or text formats.
 *
 * The function will call the given `problemGenerator` for each input in the
 * array `inputs`.  The input can be anything, it is up to the problem generator
 * to interpret it (it could be e.g. a name of a data file).  The problem
 * generator should return either a {@link Model} or a {@link ProblemDefinition}
 * (a model with parameters and warm start).  Then the function will solve the
 * model and return an array of results.
 *
 * Using {@link BenchmarkParameters} it is possible to specify additional
 * parameters of the benchmark. For example:
 *
 * * Each problem can be solved multiple times with different random
 *   random seeds (using parameter
 *   {@link BenchmarkParameters.nbSeeds | BenchmarkParameters.nbSeeds}).
 *   This is useful to get more reliable statistics about the problem performance.
 * * Multiple models can be solved in parallel to speed up the
 *   computation (using parameter
 *   {@link BenchmarkParameters.nbParallelRuns |
 *   BenchmarkParameters.nbParallelRuns}). In this case it is useful to limit
 *   the  number of threads for each solve by parameter
 *   {@link Parameters.nbWorkers | Parameters.nbWorkers}.
 * * The function can also output the results in CSV or JSON formats
 *   or export the models into JSON, JavaScript or text formats.
 *
 * See {@link BenchmarkParameters} for more details.
 *
 * If multiple models are solved (or one model with multiple seeds), this
 * function suppresses the normal output and instead it prints a table with
 * statistics of the runs. The table is printed on the standard output.
 *
 * If the array `inputs` is empty then the function writes an error message
 * to the standard output and terminates the program with exit code 1.
 *
 * In case of an error during solve, the function does not throw an exception
 * but returns {@link ErrorBenchmarkResult} for the given run.
 *
 * As {@link BenchmarkParameters} are an extension of {@link Parameters},
 * the parameter `params` can be used to overwrite parameters for all solves.
 * If `problemGenerator` returns a {@link ProblemDefinition}, then the
 * parameters from the problem definition are used as a base and the parameters
 * from `params` are used to overwrite them (using {@link combineParameters}).
 *
 * @example
 *
 * Let's suppose that we have a function `createModel` that takes a filename as
 * a parameter and returns {@link Model}. For example, the function can model
 * jobshop problem and read the data from a file.
 *
 * We are going to create a command line application around `createModel`
 * that allows to solve multiple models, using multiple random seeds,
 * run benchmarks in parallel, store results in files etc.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import * as CP from '@scheduleopt/optalcp';
 *
 * function createModel(filename: string): CP.Model {
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 *
 * let params: CP.BenchmarkParameters = {
 *   // What to print when --help is specified (assuming that the program name is mybenchmark.js):
 *   usage: "Usage: node mybenchmark.js [options] <datafile1> [<datafile2> ...",
 *   // Unless specified differently on the command line, the time limit will be 60s:
 *   timeLimit: 60
 * }
 * // Parse command line arguments. Unrecognized arguments are assumed to be file names:
 * let filenames = CP.parseSomeBenchmarkParameters(params);
 *
 * // And run the benchmark. The benchmark will call createModel for each file in filenames.
 * CP.benchmark(createModel, filenames, params);
 * ```
 *
 * The resulting program can be used for example as follows:
 *
 * ```shell
 * node mybenchmark.js --nbParallelRuns 2 --nbWorkers 2 --worker0.noOverlapPropagationLevel 4 \
 *   --output results.json --summary summary.csv --log `logs/{name}.txt` \
 *   data/*.txt
 * ```
 *
 * In this case, the program will solve all benchmarks from the directory `data`, running
 * two solves in parallel, each with two workers (threads). The first worker will use
 * propagation level 4 for the {@link Model.noOverlap}  constraint. The results will be
 * stored in JSON file `results.json` (an array of {@link BenchmarkResult} objects),
 * a summary will be stored in CSV file `summary.csv`, and the log files for individual
 * runs will be stored in the directory `logs` (one file for each run named
 * after the model, see {@link Model.setName | Model.setName}.
