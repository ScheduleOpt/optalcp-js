# OptalCP JavaScript API

This package provides JavaScript (and TypeScript) interface to [OptalCP solver](https://optalcp.com).
The name of the package is `@scheduleopt/optalcp`.

To use this package, you need the OptalCP binary on your system.
You can use the [optalcp-bin-preview](https://github.com/ScheduleOpt/optalcp-js-bin-preview) package, which provides a preview version.
The preview version solves all problems but reports only objective values, not values of the decision variables.

Usually, there's no need to install `@scheduleopt/optalcp` directly.
It is automatically installed with [optalcp-bin-preview](https://github.com/ScheduleOpt/optalcp-js-bin-preview) or `optalcp-bin` package.

The documentation for the JavaScript API can be found on the [OptalCP web page](https://optalcp.com/docs/api).
